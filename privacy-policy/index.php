          </h2>

          <p>
            Data transfers may involve storing information in a country other than the user's country of residence.
            Users are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers and the robust security measures
            implemented by Aremak to safeguard their information.

            Aremak upholds stringent security standards and procedures to safeguard customers' Personal Data. Diligent

          <p>
            Customers using appropriately configured browsers receive indications of secure information transmission,
            usually displayed through an icon such as a padlock. The combination of a secure browser at the customer's
            end and Aremak’s stringent security measures provides the most robust security currently available.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon receipt of a customer’s information, Aremak undertakes all reasonable steps to protect that
            information. When Aremak no longer requires a customer’s information, it is either destroyed or
            de-identified, adhering to record retention guidelines.
